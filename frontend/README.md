## How to run

You just need to do a simple npm install in this folder.
```bash
  npm install
```
Following that, check config.json and edit what you consider necessary for your requirements.
```bash
  vim config.json
```
Then, you can run a web server for testing purposes using the command:
```bash
  npm run start
```
If you want to build for production, just use:
```bash
  npm run build
```
